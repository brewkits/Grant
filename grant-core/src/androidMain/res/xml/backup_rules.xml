  Backup rules for Grant library

  This file excludes grant_request_history SharedPreferences from backup.

  Why? To prevent false "already requested" flags after app reinstall:
  - grant_request_history stores boolean "has requested permission X"
  - If backed up and restored after reinstall, it thinks permission was requested
  - But system sees it as fresh install (NOT_DETERMINED)
  - This causes UX inconsistency

  Solution: Exclude from backup so each install starts fresh.
